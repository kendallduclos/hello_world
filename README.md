Working on bettering the world
With the way the world is going I figured that I had better learn to code! I want to own my own company. 
My company will either interface with technology OR it will be a company selling software, either way coding will be KEY.

I am married to the most amazing person ever. We just had our first child, and he is the best thing that has ever happened to us.

I love the University of Utah Football team.
